## Overview
Collection of coding interview practice problems implemented in TypeScript.

## Topics
- Arrays
- Strings
- Hash maps

## Goal
Maintain consistent practice and reinforce problem-solving fundamentals.
Each solution includes clear problem context and time/space complexity analysis.

## Solution Structure

Each problem in this repository follows a consistent structure to emphasize clarity and interview readiness.

For every problem, the solution includes:
- A brief **problem description**
- A clear **approach explanation**
- The **implementation in TypeScript**
- **Time and space complexity analysis**

This structure mirrors how solutions should be explained during technical interviews and helps reinforce problem-solving patterns rather than memorizing answers.
